Hello World c example.

Generate a minimum C program to run on the a64sim simulator.

Notes
------------------
1. We're using the Linaro supplied aarch64 toolchain.
2. This is a 'bare metal' example. 
3. crt0.s - our custom startup code. Inits stack, clears bss, calls main, then _exit.
4. my_stubs.c - minimum system functions that need to be present if the newlib system
                functions are not used.
		_outbyte function writes to a64sim uart; characters written then to stdout.
5. main.c - uses (newlib) puts function to print the usual 'Hello World' greeting.
6. See also newlib porting guide.
